### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Richard!
<br>
I'm currently enrolled at General Assembly in the Software Engineering Immersive. I'm beginning my coding journey, and I'm excited to create using this new medium! I'm also a performing artist who creates theater...so basically, I make stuff...digitally and IRL.<br>
Get in touch!
